Steven Johnson - Where good ideas come from
===========================================

Please note that most of this report is written in an objective way, meaning that I do not automatically agree with everything that is stated here.

Questions The Book Answers
==========================

- Which environments foster innovation?
- Which characteristics do these environments have?
- How do ideas come about?
- Which phases and characteristics do ideas have?

Key Takeaways
=============

- A better understanding of ideas
- Enables you to better reflect on the process of innovation

Who Should Read This Book
=========================

Anyone interested in innovation.

My Personal Rating
==================

Without the great stories the author tells to illustrate his points, this book would be a mere 2/5.
If you're just interested in the content, don't read this book. The following summary and this TED talk(http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from) will be enough.
What makes this book worth reading are the stories and anecdotes, which earn it a 4/5.

Summary By Chapter
==================

Introduction
------------

The author states that some environments have a higher innovation output than others. He uses coral reefs and cities as an example. He also introduces the 10/10 rule, which states that it takes 10 years to build a new platform (like HDTV) and another 10 years until it's adopted by the mainstream. He names YouTube as a counterexample and argues that YouTube was a lot more innovative than HDTV, because it only took them 1 year until mainstream adoption. He deduces that the web is an innovative environment like coral reefs and cities.

Key quote:
"Our thought shapes the spaces we inhabit, and our spaces return the favor. The argument of this book is that a series of shared properties and patterns recur again and again in unusually fertile environments."


He argues that innovation has to be regarded on different zoom levels, from global evolution to cells, from ideas to information networks. He states that connecting ideas is important:
"If there is a single maxim that runs through this book's arguments, it is that we are often better served by connecting ideas than we are by protecting them."

Chapter 1 - The Adjacent Possible
---------------------------------

This chapter is full of stories illustrating the concept of the adjacent possible. This concept describes both the pace of innovation and how big of a step innovation can take at any point in time. For example, it is possible for a few molecules to combine themselves and therefore invent a cell, but it is impossible to directly invent a sunflower if you only have molecules and none of the parts you need for the sunflower. Here's a quote explaining the concept:

"Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven't visited yet. Those four rooms are the adjacent possible. But once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn't have reached from your original starting point."

This concept applies to evolution as well as man-made inventions. For example, YouTube would not have been possible 10 years earlier, because the internet was too slow and there was no Adobe Flash yet. For the rest of the chapter he illustrates this concept with examples.

Key quote:
"Innovative environments are better at helping their inhabitants explore the adjacent possible, because they expose a wide and diverse sample of spare parts - mechanical or conceptual - and they encourage novel ways of recombining those parts."

Chapter 2 - Liquid Networks
---------------------------

As the name suggests, this chapter is about networks. The term liquid network refers to a network that is neither too chaotic (gas) nor too orderly (solid). The author argues that environments or networks which find the right balance between order and chaos are more innovative than others. He backs this up with a few stories ranging from carbon atoms to buildings with modifiable walls (MIT's building 20). Here's a quote by the dean of MIT's school of architecture and planning:

"People didn't love this building for its beauty or its comfort, but for its flexibility. What we learned from Building 20's success was that we would need to provide modern services and technology without being rigid or constraining."

Chapter 3 - The Slow Hunch
--------------------------

In this chapter, the author argues that most ideas start as a hunch and slowly develop into fully fleshed ideas or innovations. However, when innovators are asked about how they got the idea, they tend to falsely state that it came to them in a flash-like way. He uses Darwin's diaries to exemplify this. He uses the story of how Tim Berners-Lee invented the web as a second example of how hunches slowly develop into ideas. The chapter contains a few more stories.

Chapter 4 - Serendipity
-----------------------

The New Oxford American Dictionary's definition of serendipity is: "the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way". The word comes from the fairy tale "The Three Princes of Serendip" who were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of".
The author argues that serendipity is an important factor when it comes to the generation of ideas. This goes hand in hand with the hunches from the previous chapter: the basic theory is that serendipity helps to lift hunches to the next level by encouraging the brain to make connections it was not able to make while it was occupied with day-to-day tasks.

Chapter 5 - Error
-----------------

Error is an important part of innovation. Quite a few things were invented while trying to do something else, for example the vacuum tube or the cardiac pacemaker. Error also helps increase creative thinking:

"Being right keeps you in place. Being wrong forces you to explore."

The chapter also contains a section explaining how error is an essential part of evolution. If reproduction were perfect, without mutations, evolution could not work.

Chapter 6 - Exaptation
----------------------

Exaptation is what evolutionary biologists call the process of an organism developing a trait optimized for a specific use, but then the trait gets hijacked for a completely different function. A popular example are feathers: their original function was keeping their owners warm. Later on, they were used for flying. This concept is essential to evolution because feathers that don't keep you warm and don't enable you to fly are not very useful. Therefore, feathers would never have survived the evolutionary process.
This process is also common among human innovation, which is shown in this chapter by countless examples and stories. The conclusion for the workspace is that a cross-disciplinary coffeehouse environment, where ideas can spread, is more innovative than an environment where each discipline lives in its own silo.

Chapter 7 - Platforms
---------------------

I don't think engineers need to be told the benefits of platforms. We work with them every day. Computer science especially makes heavy use of countless of layers of abstraction piled on top of each other. As always, this chapter contains some stories and anecdotes and broadens the reader's view on what a platform can be; for example GPS, coral reefs or the web.

Conclusion
----------

In this chapter, the author backs up his thesis with data. In the previous chapters he has been using stories as "proof" of his theories. In the conclusion, he zooms out and categorizes the inventions of certain time periods into 4 quadrants: market/individual, market/network, non-market/individual and non-market/network. Innovations with a single inventor get classified as individual, everything that was invented by a larger group of people gets the network tag. Inventions with the market tag are proprietary, for-profit whereas non-market inventions are not directly capitalized on by its inventor(s) and can flow freely.
The result of this analysis is that most inventions in recent times have come out of the non-market/network quadrant. It backs up his initial claim that we are better to connect ideas than to protect them.
